## Tic Tac Toe: Player vs. Player
### Exercise

For this assignment, you will be bringing Tic Tac Toe to life on your own.

#### Requirements:

Do worry about:
1. Alternating turns. After a player has placed down an X, the next tap must be an O.
2. Your layout must include a label to display whose turn it is and another label to keep count of the wins.
3. You must include a reset button. This resets the game, of course.
4. Win condition checking. 3-in-a-row means the game is over, so no more moves should be allowed until the reset button is tapped.

Don't worry about:
1. Don't worry too much about layout at the moment. You'll learn how to make your app pretty in a later project. See below for our ~lowered~ expectations.

Alternatively, you can add images to your blue ```Assets.xcassets``` folder in the Project Navigator sidebar in case you're into that.

#### Hints:

1. You should use buttons for each square.
2. There is probably an easier way to do things. Instead of control-dragging 9 different outlets and actions to your ```ViewController```, you can code your logic to take in which button is clicked. Or you can do 9 drags, whatever you want.
3. You can add inspectable properties if you sub-class a button-- particular IBInspectable to keep track of rows and cols. This will help you keep track of which button is clicked.

4. Alternatively, you can tag your buttons within the attributes inspector.

## The ```git``` side of things

1. Fork this repo if you haven't already.
2. Clone your **own** fork to your local project directory in Terminal.
	```
	git clone https://github.com/YOURNAMEHERE/AC-iOS-tictactoe.git
	```
3. At this point you should be able to open the project in that folder and have a working table showing titles and dates. Work on the assignment and when you're done when you're done `commit` inside XCode or on the Terminal command line and then run the below. That will `push` your changes up to that branch on your fork. 
	```
	git add .
	git commit -am "I made these changes"
	git push origin master
	```
4. Feel free to `commit` early and often as a "checkpoint" of sorts to save your work.
5. Make a pull request from **your** fork to C4Q/master at the Github site once you're done.
6. Take a breather. We did it, Reddit!
